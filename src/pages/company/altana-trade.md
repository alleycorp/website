  # Making trade safer, more efficient, and more profitable

  Global trade is vital, yet it isnâ€™t working well. There are trillions of dollars in illicit trade each year. Companies cannot access financing and trade partners. Inefficiencies slow the movement of legal goods across borders.

  To improve trade, we must deeply understand the global trade network. Through a shared artificial intelligence platform, Altana helps regulators, businesses financial service providers, and logistics providers learn from global economic data to realize better trade.
