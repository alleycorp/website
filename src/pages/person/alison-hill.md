description: >-
  Alison Hill is a top-level Executive/Personal Assistant with more than twenty
  years experience supporting some of New York’s most prestigious executives at
  GILT, Cole Haan, GUCCI, Citicorp, and Cushman & Wakefield. As a result of many
  years working alongside, and learning from, some of New York’s best and
  brightest, the scope of Alison’s responsibilities have expanded far beyond
  that of a traditional Executive Assistant role. When she isn’t glued to a
  laptop, she enjoys spending time at the beach, exploring other
  countries/cultures, and relentlessly trying to develop a passion for running.
