Alison Hill is a top-level Executive/Personal Assistant with more than
twenty years experience supporting some of New York’s most prestigious
executives at GILT, Cole Haan, GUCCI, Citicorp, and Cushman & Wakefield.
As a result of many years working alongside, and learning from, some of
New York’s best and brightest, the scope of Alison’s responsibilities have
expanded far beyond that of a traditional Executive Assistant role. When
she isn’t glued to a laptop, she enjoys spending time at the beach,
exploring other countries/cultures, and relentlessly trying to develop a
passion for running.
